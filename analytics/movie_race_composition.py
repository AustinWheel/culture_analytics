# goal is to find the race composition of the movies
# this will be done by iterating over all movies and retrieving the cast
# then we will iterate over the cast and retrieve their dialog grouped by race
# finally we will calculate the percentage
# groups: >90%, 70-90%, 50-70%, 30-50%, 10-30%, <10%
